---------------------------------------
- Summary
---------------------------------------

XMake (eXtended cMake) is a helper script to use in combination with GIT
submodules to more easily compile complex applications relying on a lot of libraries.

See http://www.idiap.ch/~pabbet/articles/combining-git-submodules-and-cmake-for-library-development/
for a detailed explanation of the problem and the way I setup my projects
using XMake, CMake and GIT submodules.

- Examples & tests
---------------------------------------

The 'test' folder contain a sample CMake project using XMake.
